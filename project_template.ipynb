      The available data is presented on a yearly basis from 1997 onwards and on a monthly basis from 1999 to 2024. 
      For this assignment, we will focus on the data related to flight movements and passengers at Dutch airports. 
      For flight movements, the dataset shows differences between commercial air traffic flights and local flights.
      The dataset includes all the data for the period before COVID-19 (2015-2019) and after COVID-19 (2021-2024) that we need to process for the assignment.
